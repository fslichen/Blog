The world consist of one thing : null -> 0
The world also has an operation called not
therefore, another thing is created by not null - > 1
therefore we have 0 and 1
And then we have everything.
The buda is right by pointing out that the world is actually null, but it fails to point out there is also an operation called not. 

So it is ok to claim that the world has only one thing which is null
The world also has only one operation called not
And then we have everything.

This is the conceptual machine. 
The universe is a conceptual machine. 
matter is just a form of information 0101001
enery is another form of information 10101001
time is the other form of information 0101010011000
