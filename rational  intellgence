These days, people have been using neuron network. 
however, the neuron network is very irrational
take the xor problem for example,
with sufficient data, the neuron network can actually solve the xor problem by adjusting its weights. 
But it does not understand the logicial, it's irrational
The most precise way to sovle the xor problem is like :
if (x != y) {
  return 1;
} else {
  return 0;
}
so a true learning is like, after studying the given data, the program will be able to generate the code above. 
so a method is like, the compueter just randomly generate the code, and then make adjustment to the code with the help of the new data.
Actually, this is how many programmers do the debuging.

So the programer just "estimate" the code, and then test their program. And then use the test data to analyze and evaluate the program
once they find a bug, they make adjustment to the code. So instead of training a neuron network, it's using data to train the code. 
But that involves the human intellgence : data -> code -> output -> human brain -> update code -> data...

being able to update the code is rational intellgence, and this process involves some logical thinking skills and some imagination as well. 

still wondering what makes us humans.
