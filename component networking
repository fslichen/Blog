so instead of letting different neurons working together, 
why don't you let several rational components work together?
one neuron does not have any intellgence, it's mechanical,
So why don't we just make this neuron a little bit more functional, 

What i mean by component is that, the component is a concise piece of program. well, it's mechanical, but when different component are
working together, there will be intellgence

So we need do design a dynamic mechanism that let these components work together. The simpliest way can be, you just randomize the 
dynamic mechanism.

the component can be regarded as a functional and complex neuron, and it's still mechanical.

When so many component are working together, we humans probably have no idea what is going on, but it can solve the program, that
is artificial intellence.
