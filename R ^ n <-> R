R ^ n <-> R is possible because:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
...
8 -> 9
9 -> 11
and
, -> 0
therefore (2,3) -> 304
that is why R^n <-> R is possbile 
well it is true that you can do like map.put(key,value)
but you can also put an object into a higher dimensional space like map.put(value, key1, key2, key3)
in java the hash code mechanism makes key1, key2, key3 into a unique key. it's an implementation of R^n <-> R
